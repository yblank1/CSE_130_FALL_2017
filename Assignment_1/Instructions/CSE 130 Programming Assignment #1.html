<b>Note:</b>
See <a href="https://ucsd-pl.github.io/cse-130-230/fa17/info_ocaml.html"> this </a> for instructions on
starting OCaml in the ACS lab machines.
To download and install OCaml version 4.02 on your home machines see the
instructions <a href="http://ocaml.org/docs/install.html">here</a>.
Remember that this is only to enable you to play with the assignment
at home: the final version turned in must work on the ACS Linux machines.

While you can use windows to begin working with OCaml, the code you
turn in must be that required for the Linux environment.

<hr size="5" noshade="noshade">
<h3 align="center"><b>Code Documentation and General Requirements</b></h3>
<p>Code for all programming assignments should be <b>well
documented</b>. A working program with no comments will <b>receive
only partial credit</b>. Documentation entails writing a description
of each function/method, class/structure, as well as comments throughout
the code to explain  the program logic. Comments in OCaml are enclosed
within (* *), and may be nested.
It is understood that some of the exercises in this programming assignment
require extremely little code and will not require extensive comments.

</p><p>While few programming assignments pretend to mimic the "real"
world, they may, nevertheless, contain some of the ambiguity that exists
outside the classroom. If, for example, an assignment is amenable to
differing interpretations, such that more than one algorithm may implement
a correct solution to the assignment, it is incumbent upon the
programmer to document not only the functionality of the algorithm (and
more broadly his/her interpretation of the program requirements), but to
articulate <b>clearly</b> the reasoning behind a particular choice of
solution.</p>


<hr size="5" noshade="noshade">
<h3 align="center">Assignment Overview</h3>
<p>The overall objective of this assignment is for you to gain some
hands-on experience with OCaml. All the problems require relatively little
code ranging from 2 to 15 lines.
If any function requires more than that,
you can be sure that you need to rethink your solution.
The assignment is in the files <a href="https://ucsd-pl.github.io/cse-130-230/fa17/pa1/misc.ml">misc.ml</a>, and <a href="https://ucsd-pl.github.io/cse-130-230/fa17/pa1/test.ml">test.ml</a>
that you need to download.
The file contains several skeleton OCaml functions, with missing
bodies, i.e. expressions, which currently contain the text
<code> failwith "to be written" </code>.
Your task is to replace the text in those files with the
the appropriate OCaml code for each of those expressions.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> All the solutions can be done using the purely
functional fragment of OCaml, using constructs covered in class, and most
require the use of <i>recursion</i>. Solutions using imperative features
such as references, while loops or library functions will receive <b>no credit</b>. </p>
It is a good idea to start this assignment early; ML programming, while
quite simple (when you know how), often seems somewhat foreign at first,
particularly when it comes to recursion and list manipulation.<p></p>


<hr size="5" noshade="noshade">
<h3 align="center">Assignment Testing and Evaluation</h3>
<p>Your functions/programs <b>must</b> compile and/or run on a <b>Linux</b> ACS machine (e.g. <tt> ieng6.ucsd.edu </tt>,
  as this is where the verification of your solutions will occur. While
  you may develop your code on any system, ensure that your code runs as
  expected on an ACS machine prior to submission.
    You should test your code in the directories from
  which the zip files (see below) will be created, as this will approximate the
  environment used for grading the assignment.</p>

  <p>Most of the points, except those for comments and style, will be <b>awarded
  automatically, by evaluating your functions against a given test suite</b>.
  The fourth file, <tt> test.ml </tt> contains a very small suite of tests which
  gives you a flavor of of these tests. At any stage, by typing at the UNIX
  shell : <br>
  </p><blockquote>
    <code> ocaml test.ml &gt; log </code>
  </blockquote>
    you will get a report on how your code stacks up against the simple
    tests.
    <p></p>
  <p> The last line of the file <tt>log</tt> <b> must contain the word
    "Compiled" otherwise you get a zero for the whole assignment</b>.
  If for some problem, you cannot get the code to compile, leave it as is with the
  <code>failwith ...</code>, with your partial solution enclosed below as a comment.
  <b> There will be no exceptions to this rule</b>.
  The second last line of the log file will contain your overall score, and the
  other lines will give you a readout for each test.
  You are encouraged to try to understand the code in <tt>test.ml</tt>, and
  subsequently devise your own tests and add them to <tt>test.ml</tt>, but
  you will not be graded on this.
</p>
  <p>Alternately, inside the OCaml shell, type (user input is in <font color="#FF000">red</font>):
    </p><blockquote>
      <code> # <font color="#FF0000"> #use "test.ml";; </font><br>
	.<br>
	.<br>
	.<br>
	val it = (...,...) : int * int
	</code>
      </blockquote>
      and it should return a pair of integers, reflecting your score and
      the max possible score on the sample tests. If instead an error
      message appears, your code will receive a zero.

<a name="Submission Guidelines"></a>
<h3 align="center">Submission Instructions</h3>

<h3>1. Create the zip file for submission</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your solutions to this assignment will be stored in separate
  files under a directory called <tt>solution/</tt>, inside which you will
  place the files: <tt> misc.ml</tt>.
  There should be <b>no other files in the directory</b>.</p>


  <p>After creating and populating the directory as described above,
  create a zip file called
  <tt>&lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa1.zip</tt> by going into
  the directory <tt> solution </tt> and executing
  the UNIX shell command: <br>
  </p><blockquote>
    <tt> zip &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa1.zip *</tt>
  </blockquote>

  You can refer to
  an <a href="https://ucsd-pl.github.io/cse-130-230/fa17/pa1/LastName_FirstName_cse130_pa1.zip">example submission
  file</a> to compare with yours. Make sure that your zipped file's
  structure is the same as the example.
  </blockquote>

<h3>2. Test the zip file to check for its validity</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Once you've created the zip file with your solutions, you will
  use the <tt> validate_pa1</tt> program to see whether your zip
  file's structure is well-formed to be inspected by our grading
  system by executing the UNIX shell command: <br>
  </p><blockquote><tt> validate_pa1 &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa1.zip </tt>
  </blockquote>
  The <tt>validate_pa1</tt> program will output <tt>OK</tt> if your
  zip file is well-formed and your solution is compiled.
  Otherwise, it will output some error
  messages. Before going to step 3, make sure that your zip file
  passes <tt>validate_pa1</tt> program. <b>Otherwise
  you get a zero for the whole assignment.</b>
  If you have any trouble with
  this, refer to the instructions in step 1.
</blockquote>

<h3>3. Submit the zip file via the <tt>turnin_pa1</tt> program</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Once your zip file passes the validation check
  by <tt>validate_pa1</tt>, you will use the <tt> turnin_pa1</tt> program
  to submit this file for grading by going into the
  directory <tt>solution/</tt> and executing the UNIX shell
  command: <br>
  </p><blockquote><tt> turnin_pa1
      &lt;LastName&gt;_&lt;FirstName&gt;_cse130_pa1.zip </tt>
  </blockquote>
    <p></p>
  <p>
  The <tt>turnin_pa1</tt> program will provide you with a confirmation of the
  submission process; make sure that the size of the file indicated by
  <tt>turnin_pa1</tt> matches the size of your tar file. Note that you 
may submit multiple times, but your latest submission overwrites 
previous submissions, and will be the ONLY one we grade. If you submit 
before the assignment deadline, and again afterwards, we will count it 
as if you only submitted after the deadline.

<h2>Problem #1: <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdditivePersistence.html">
    Digital Roots and Additive Persistence</a>
<tt> (misc.ml) </tt>
</h2>
<h3>(a)<b> 10 points </b></h3>
<p>Now write an OCaml function <tt> sumList : int list -&gt; int </tt> that
takes an integer list <tt> l </tt>
and returns the sum of the elements of <tt> l </tt>.
Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">sumList [1;2;3;4];;</font><br>
    - : int = 10<br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">sumList [1;-2;3;5];;</font><br>
    - : int = 7<br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">sumList [1;3;5;7;9;11];;</font><br>
    - : int = 36<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(b)<b> 10 points </b></h3>
<p>Write an OCaml function <tt> digitsOfInt : int -&gt; int list</tt> that
takes an integer <tt> n </tt>
as an argument and if the integer is positive (i.e. I don't care what you
return for the argument <tt> 0 </tt> or any negative number),
returns the list of digits of <tt> n </tt> in the order in which they
appear in <tt> n </tt>. Once you have implemented the function,
you should get the following behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">digitsOfInt 3124;;</font><br>
    - : int list = [3;1;2;4] <br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">digitsOfInt 352663;;</font><br>
    - : int list = [3;5;2;6;6;3]<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>



<h3>(c)<b> 10+10 points </b></h3>
<p>Consider the process of taking a number, adding its digits,
   then adding the digits of the number derived from it, etc.,
   until the remaining number has only one digit.
   The number of additions required to obtain a single digit from a number n
   is called the <i>additive persistence</i> of n, and the digit obtained is called
   the <i>digital root</i> of n.
   For example, the sequence obtained from the starting number 9876 is (9876, 30, 3), so
   9876 has an additive persistence of 2 and a digital root of 3.
   Write two OCaml functions <tt> additivePersistence : int -&gt; int </tt> and
   <tt> digitalRoot : int -&gt; int </tt> that take positive
   integer arguments <tt> n </tt>
   and return respectively the additive persistence and the digital root of <tt> n </tt>.
   Once you have implemented the functions, you should get the following
   behavior at the OCaml prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">additivePersistence 9876;;</font><br>
    - : int = 2<br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">digitalRoot 9876;;</font><br>
    - : int = 3<br>
 </tt></p>

<h2>Problem #2: Palindromes
<tt> (misc.ml) </tt></h2>

  <h3>(a)<b> 15 points</b></h3>
<p>Without using any built-in OCaml functions, write an OCaml function <tt> listReverse : 'a
list -&gt; 'a list </tt> that
takes a list <tt> l </tt> as an argument and returns a list of the elements of <tt> l
</tt> in the reversed order.
Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">listReverse [1;2;3;4];;</font><br>
    - : int list = [4;3;2;1]<br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">listReverse ["a";"b";"c";"d"];;</font><br>
    - : string list = ["d";"c";"b";"a"]<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>(b)<b> 5 points </b></h3>
<p>A <i>palindrome</i> is a word that reads the same from left-to-right and
right-to-left. Write an OCaml function <tt> palindrome : string -&gt; bool </tt> that
takes a string <tt> w </tt> and returns true if the string is a palindrome and false
otherwise. Your function should be case sensitie. You may want to use the OCaml function <tt> explode </tt>.  (<i>Hint: You may call your <tt>listReverse</tt> function from your <tt>palindrome</tt> function</i>.)
Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the OCaml prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # <font color="#FF0000">palindrome "malayalam";;</font><br>
    - : bool = true<br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">palindrome "Malayalam";;</font><br>
    - : bool = false<br>
    # <font color="#FF0000">palindrome "myxomatosis";;</font><br>
    - : bool = false<br>
